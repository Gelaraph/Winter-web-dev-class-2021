        <h1>CASCADING STYLE SHEET (CSS)</h1>
        <p> CSS (<span class="abrev">C</span>ascading <span class="abrev">S</span>tyle <span class="abrev">S</span>heets) is used for adding styles (e.g. fonts, colors, spacing)
             to Web documents. <br>The format for saving a CSS file is "the name .css" <br>
            <br>e.g: style.css</p>
        
        <p>To apply CSS to an HTML element you need to select the element
            and CSS provides you with a number of different ways to select the elements 
            and apply rules to them. <br> But to understand how selectors work and their role in CSS,
             it's important to know the parts of a <span id="rule">CSS rule.</span></p> 
            <blockquote>
                <p>A CSS rule is a block of code, containing one 
                    or more selectors and one or more declarations.</p>
            </blockquote> <br>
            
        <h2>Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h2>
         <p> A style sheet consists of a list of rules and  
            each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block.</p>
           
         <p>Let's disect how CSS actually works using this diagram:</p>
           <figure>

               <figcaption id="itallic">The whole structure is called a ruleset.</figcaption>
           </figure><br>
           <h3>Explanation of the diagram</h3>
           <ul>
             <li>
                 <h4>Selectors</h4>
                 <p> This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. 
                     It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, 
                     < p > elements). To style a different element, change the selector.</p>
             </li>
             <li>
                 <h4>Properties</h4>
                <p>In this example color is a property of the p element.
                    In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect to the element.</p>
             <li>
                <h4>Property value</h4>
                <p>To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. 
                    This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. 
                    (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)</p>
             </li>
             <li>
                 <h4>Declaration</h4>
                <p>A declaration block includes a CSS property name and a property value
                     pair which applies styles to the elements matched by the selectors. 
                It should be noted however that a rule can contain more than
                one declaration and are separated by semicolons.<br>
                Also, declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</p>
             </li>
        </ul>

          <h2>CSS SELECTORS</h2>  
          <p>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select)
             the HTML elements you want to style and there are many different types of selectors.<br>
             Here are some of the most common types of selectors:</p>   
    <br>
        <table>
            <thead id="head">
                <td>Selector Name</td>
                <td>What it selects</td>
                <td>Example</td>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Element selector <br>(sometimes called a tag <br>or type selector)</td>
                    <td>All HTML elements of the specified type.</td>
                    <td>p selects paragraph tag </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>ID Selector</td>
                    <td>The element on the page with the specified ID on a given HTML page, Each id value should be unique.</td>
                        <td>#my-id
                            selects <p id="my-id"> or<br> <a id="my-id"> </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Class Selector</td>
                    <td>The element(s) on the page with the specified class. 
                        <br>Multiple instances of the same class can appear on a page.</td>
                    <td>img[src]
                        selects [img src="myimage.png"] <br>but not img tag </td>  
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Pseudo-class selector</td>
                    <td>The specified element(s), <br>
                        but only when in the specified state. <br>
                        (For example, when a cursor hovers over a link.)</td>
                        <td>a:hover
                            selects <a>, but only when <br>the mouse pointer is hovering over the link.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Attribute selector</td>
                    <td>The element(s) on the page with the specified attribute.</td>
                    <td>img[src]
                        selects [img src="myimage.png"] but not img tag </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
